Plan:


- Read in Airfoil geometries / points from online website and plot it
- Have user select points on the plot to be booms
- Have user set properties of the booms
- Have user set thickness and E? of each skin
- Run an algorithm to figure out all paths between booms (applying graph theory)
- Get the lengths of each skin section
